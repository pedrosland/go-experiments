# Go Experiments

This repo contains a mixture of Go things that I've been playing with.
It isn't meant to make sense :)
Some things are just there for me to try new ideas or approaches.
Others come from books (gopl.io) or are inspired by real life problems.

Note that the job_queue_gist is not my creation.
